title: Deep Representation Learning
---

This open-source textbook, "Learning Deep Representations of Data Distributions" by Sam Buchanan, Druv Pai, Peng Wang, and Yi Ma (published in 2025), explores how deep neural networks learn compact representations of high-dimensional data. It emphasizes representation learning as the core of deep learning's power, explaining design principles through optimization and information theory. Aimed at advanced undergraduate or graduate students with backgrounds in linear algebra, probability, and machine learning, the book provides a mathematically-oriented approach to deep learning and discusses its applications and future directions.
